  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>Hi world! I'm Swati Tomar — a simple, ambitious girl currently wrestling with this "simple" assessment 
    (which, by the way, is not as simple as it claims). The world you see here? Nope, 
    that’s just the trailer. My real world is way more dramatic, like a Bollywood plot twist! 
    I'm a student at the National Institute of Technology, Agartala, proudly surviving the rollercoaster of 
    Electrical Engineering. But guess what? I'm not just sticking to wires and circuits — I'm learning skills 
    far beyond my branch (because why not make life even more exciting, right?). The future? I hope it’s kind — to me 
    and to every dreamer out there who’s trying, failing, learning, and trying again. Let’s just say: 
    may our coffee be strong, our code bug-free, and our ambitions louder than our doubts!</p>

  <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>

  <script>
    
    console.log("Page has loaded!");

    
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Button was clicked!");
      
     
      alert("Hello from JavaScript!");

     
      button.textContent = "Clicked!";
    });
  </script>

</body>
