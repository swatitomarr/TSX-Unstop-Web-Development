Greetings Techsonixsolutions Team,

My name is Swati Tomar, currently in my 3rd year pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the National Institute of 
Technology, Agartala.

I am sincerely grateful to Techsonix Solutions for giving me this opportunity to work as a web development intern. 
During this internship, I’ve been assigned two assignments and a major project — developing a personal portfolio 
website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has allowed me to apply my knowledge, strengthen my frontend
 development skills, and gain practical exposure to real-world tasks.

I truly appreciate the trust and support you've given me, and I’m dedicated to putting in my best efforts throughout 
this internship. Thank you once again for this wonderful learning opportunity.

With gratitude,

Swati Tomar
